# Team Profile Builder

## Description
A team profile builder that will generate cards for each employee. Builds upon HTML and CSS concepts from the past as well as utilizing Node JS to accomplish the project. This project practices object-oriented programming, creating various class objects and utilizing them to manage and pass data along so that it can be displayed on a webpage. This project also practices test-driven development, creating and testing scenarios using the 'Jest' package and ensuring everything works as intended.

## Installation
All dependencies are included in the package.json. Using the 'npm i' or 'npm install' commands will install all necessary packages.

## Usage
Once all packages have been installed, simply run the program using 'node index.js'. Answer the following prompts as necessary and add as many employees as needed. Once the user selects 'Finish' during the last prompt, the program will end and an html file will be generated, properly displaying all the employees and their information as entered by the user.
